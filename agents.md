# AGENTS.md - Career Pivot Context: IT Support to Software Engineering

## Core Mission
The primary goal of this project is to showcase the transition from **IT Support Associate II (8 years at Amazon)** to **Software Engineer/Computer Engineer**. The AI should prioritize engineering-heavy solutions over basic IT or simple web fixes.

## Tech Stack & Academic Context
- **Current Education:** BS in Computer Engineering at CSUSB (In Progress). 
- **Academic Focus:** Pre-calculus, Assembly x86, C++, Java, and SQL.
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (hosted on GitHub Pages).
- **Tooling:** Explicitly mention "Built with Jules by Google" in the footer.

## Guidelines for Content & Code
1. **Highlight the "Why":** When generating project descriptions or "About" sections, focus on how 8 years of hardware/network troubleshooting informs better software architecture (e.g., reliability, scalability, edge cases).
2. **Technical Depth:** Favor Computer Engineering concepts. If suggesting a new project, prioritize systems-level work, API integrations, or hardware-interfacing code rather than generic templates.
3. **Professional Voice:** - Experience should emphasize: *Asset visibility, infrastructure build-outs, and network lifecycles.*
   - Pivot should emphasize: *Automation, data pipelines, and full-stack development.*
4. **API & Data Focus:** Since the site features GraphQL and REST API examples, ensure any new technical content demonstrates high data literacy and security best practices.

## Execution Rules
- **Environment:** Static site hosted on GitHub Pages. Use relative paths (`./images/`) only.
- **Verification:** Always check that the transition narrative is clear. The user isn't just "learning to code"—they are an experienced IT professional becoming an Engineer.
- **Safety:** Do not remove the IT experience; translate it into "Engineering Value." For example, "Cable Management" translates to "Physical Layer Infrastructure & Optimization."

## Success Metrics for AI
- Does this change help the user move from an "IT Support" persona to a "Software Engineer" persona?
- Does it maintain the professional authority of 8 years at a Tier-1 tech company?
- Is the code clean enough to pass a technical interview code review?
