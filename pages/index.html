                                <h3>Cable Management</h3>
                                <p>In the fast-paced environment of an Amazon warehouse, organized and efficient cable management is crucial. I worked on projects to overhaul the network racks, transforming them from a chaotic web of cables into a model of clarity and order. This not only improved aesthetics but also significantly reduced downtime by simplifying troubleshooting and maintenance.</p>

                                <h3>End User Equipment Deployments</h3>
                                <p>I was responsible for the deployment of thousands of end-user equipment (scanners, laptops/desktops, printers, tablets, radios, and peripherals). This involved creating a streamlined process for imaging, configuration, and deployment, ensuring that every device was ready for use with minimal disruption to warehouse operations. I also developed a system for tracking and managing equipment, which improved asset visibility and reduced loss.</p>

                                <p>I deployed and maintained equipment for the new build out. This included upgrading network hardware, expanding network capacity to meet growing demand, and troubleshooting complex network issues.</p>

                                <p>I was part of the team that built out the IT infrastructure for several new Amazon warehouses. This was a massive undertaking that involved installing and configuring and cable managing network cabinets (IDFs, 21 for one site) I was responsible for ensuring that all IT infrastructure was installed to Amazon's high standards and was ready to support the needs of the new site from day one.</p>
