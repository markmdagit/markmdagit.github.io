                    <p>In this post, we'll look at how JavaScript was used to make this portfolio more interactive. Static HTML and CSS are great for structure and style, but JavaScript is what brings a page to life.</p>
                    <p>The main interactive feature on the homepage is the tabbed navigation. When you click on a tab like "Skills", "Experience", or "Blog", the content below dynamically changes without reloading the entire page. This is achieved by listening for click events on the navigation buttons and then toggling the visibility of the corresponding content sections.</p>
                    <p>This is a simple but effective way to improve the user experience. It makes the site feel faster and more responsive. In the future, I plan to add more dynamic features, such as fetching project details from an external API.</p>
