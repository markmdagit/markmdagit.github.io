<div class="entry">
    <p>This portfolio is a living project, and I have many ideas for future enhancements. This post is a sneak peek into what's coming next.</p>
    <p>One of the top priorities is to build out the "Projects" section. I plan to connect it to a database (likely using a headless CMS or a service like Supabase) to dynamically load my projects. This will allow me to easily add new projects and provide more details for each one, including live demos and links to the source code.</p>
    <p>Another feature I'm excited about is creating a fully functional blog. The current blog posts are static HTML files, but I want to build a proper blogging platform where I can write and manage posts more efficiently. This will likely involve a backend component and a database.</p>
    <p>Thank you for following along on this journey. I'm excited to continue building and improving this site!</p>
