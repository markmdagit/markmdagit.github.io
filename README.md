## How to View This Website

This website uses modern web technologies (HTMX) to load content dynamically. For security reasons, these technologies do not work when you open the `index.html` file directly from your computer.

To view the website correctly, you need to serve it from a simple local web server. Python provides a built-in web server that you can start with a single command.

### Running the Local Server

1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**
2.  **Navigate to the root directory of this project.**
3.  **Run the following command:**

    ```bash
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```

4.  **Open your web browser** and go to the following address:

    **http://localhost:8000/**

You should now see the website with all its styling and functionality working correctly.
